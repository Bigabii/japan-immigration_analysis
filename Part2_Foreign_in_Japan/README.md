# ** PART II: Immigration in Japan: Data Analysis & Visualization**

This part of the project explores immigration patterns in Japan using data analysis (Python, Pandas, SQL) and interactive visualizations (Tableau). 
The goal is to identify the main immigrant nationalities, their status of residence, and their geographic concentration across the country.

##  Questions

1. **What are the top 10 immigrant nationalities by entry type in Japan in 2023**  
   â†’ Filtered using Python (Pandas/SQL).

2. **What are the most common status of residence for each nationalities? 
How are these groups distributed across the country's prefectures?**  
   â†’ Displayed in an interactive Dashboard in Tableau.

3. **What are the top 5 immigrant nationalities residing in Japan?**  
   â†’ Filtered using Python (Pandas/SQL).

4. **How are these nationalities distributed across the country's prefectures?**
   â†’ Filtered using Python (Pandas/SQL).
