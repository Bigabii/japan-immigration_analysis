**Immigration in Japan: Data Analysis & Visualization**

This project explores immigration patterns in Japan using data analysis (Python, Pandas, SQL) and interactive visualizations (Tableau). 
The goal is to identify the main immigrant nationalities, their status of residence, and their geographic concentration across the country.

##  Questions

1. **What are the top 5 immigrant nationalities residing in Japan?**  
   â†’ Filtered using Python (Pandas/SQL).

2. **What are the most common occupations for each nationality?**  
   â†’ Displayed in an interactive bar chart in Tableau.

4. **How are these groups distributed across the country's prefectures?**  
   â†’ Shown in a geographical map visualization (Tableau).

## Dashboard on Tableau

- Brazilians tend to reside in industrial regions such as Aichi, Shizuoka, and Mie.
- Vietnamese immigrants are concentrated in areas with a high number of technical internships.
