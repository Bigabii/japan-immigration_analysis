# Part I – Labor Conditions by Prefecture in Japan (2023 data)

In this part of the project, I explored labor conditions across Japanese prefectures using real government datasets. The analysis focuses on:

- Average salary per gender
- Gender pay gap by region
- Weekly/Monthly working hours

### Tools
- Excel (data collected, cleaning)
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Tableau (map of average salary | average worked hours/month by gender)

###  Main insights:
- [✔] Highest gender pay gap regions: Kochi, Hyogo, Kanagawa, Ibaraki, Oita
- [✔] Prefectures with highest salary: 
      For Men: Kochi, Hyogo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Kyoto
      For Women: Tokyo, Hyogo, Kyoto, Kanagawa, Hiroshima
  
- [✔] Prefectures with less hours per month worked:
      For Men: Kochi, Tottori, Okinawa, Akita, Ibaraki
      For Women: Tochigi, Gunma, Tokyo, Toyama, Yamanashi

- [✔] Disparities in hours worked vs salary highlighted on map
